# constructoroverloading
Every constructor has same name as class name but they differ in terms of either number of arguments or the datatypes of the arguments or the both .
As there is more than one constructor in class it is also called multiple constructor.<br/>

It is quite similar to function overloading.
Overloaded constructors essentially have the same name (name of the class) and different number of arguments.<br/>
A constructor is called depending upon the number and type of arguments passed.<br/>
While creating the object, arguments must be passed to let compiler know, which constructor needs to be called.<br/>
